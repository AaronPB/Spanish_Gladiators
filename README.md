# Spanish_Gladiators
Basic Java Programming - Gladiator turn-based combats!
## How to start a combat

First of all, the program will show you both gladiators and their predefined properties, which are: name, health and strength.

You can edit the default properties of your gladiator (gladiator 2) pressing `1` (name editor), `2` (health editor) or `3` (strength editor).

To save your gladiator just press `4`, and the combat will start!

### Choose a name for your gladiator!
